        <h1>Coffee with Ted.</h1> 
        <p>I like to have a cup of <a href="http://www.tonx.org", target="new" >coffee</a> and watch a 5 minute <a href="http://www.ted.com", target="new">TED</a> talk in the morning. Good coffee and presentations get my mind moving.  I refer back to the experience and information frequently throughout the day. This influences my <a href="http://medium.com/@smapdi", target="new">thoughts</a> and <a href="http://www.riggingdojo.com", target="new">work</a>.
